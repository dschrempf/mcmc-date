-- | State space containing all parameters.
--
-- We are interested in inferring an ultrametric time tree with branch lengths
-- measured in units of time (e.g., in million years). Let i be a branch of the
-- time tree. Further, let T_i be the length of branch i, and R_i be the
-- absolute evolutionary rate on this branch. Then, the length of branch i
-- measured in average number of substitutions is d_i=T_i*R_i.
--
-- Internally, a relative time t_i and relative rate r_i are stored and used
-- such that the branch length measured in average number of substitution is
-- d_i=T_i*R_i=(t_i*h)*(r_i*mu), where h is the root height of the time tree,
-- and mu is the mean rate.
--
-- In brief, the relative time and rate are defined as t_i=T_i/h, and
-- r_i=R_i/mu.
--
-- This has various advantages:
--
-- 1. The ultrametric tree object storing the relative times is a normalized
--    tree with root height 1.0.
--
-- 2. The relative rates have a mean of 1.0.
--
-- 3. The absolute times and rates can be scaled easily by proposing new values
--    for h or mu.
--
-- NOTE: The relative times and rates are stored using two separate tree
-- objects: (1) An ultrametric time tree, and (2) an unconstrained rate tree.
-- The separation of the two trees allows usage of two different types:
--
-- (1) The time tree is of type 'HeightTree' because the ultrametricity
--     constraint allows the change of node heights only.
--
-- (2) The rate tree is of type 'Tree' because the branch lengths are not
--     limited by any other constraints than being positive.
--
-- Accordingly, the types of the proposals ensure that they are used on the
-- correct tree objects.
--
-- NOTE: Absolute times can only be inferred if node calibrations are available.
-- Otherwise, the time tree height will be left unchanged at 1.0, and relative
-- times will be inferred.
--
-- NOTE: The topologies of the time and rate trees are equal. This is, however,
-- not ensured by the types. Equality of the topology could be ensured by using
-- one tree storing both, the times and the rates.
