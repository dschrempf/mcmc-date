-- | Slide nodes contrarily at given path.
--
-- This proposal acts on a pair of trees. The first tree is an ultrametric tree
-- (see "Mcmc.Tree.Proposal.Ultrametric"), usually the time tree with branches
-- denoting absolute or relative time. The second tree is an unconstrained tree
-- (see "Mcmc.Tree.Proposal.Unconstrained"), usually the rate tree with branches
-- denoting absolute or relative rates.
--
-- The specified nodes of both trees are slid contrarily. For example, if the
-- parent branch of the ultrametric tree node is shortened, the parent branch of
-- the unconstrained tree node is elongated. Ultrametricity is maintained.
--
-- A normal distribution truncated at the height of the parent node of the
-- ultrametric tree and the oldest daughter node of the ultrametric tree is used
-- to determine the new node height of the ultrametric tree. The rates are
-- changed accordingly.
--
-- See 'Mcmc.Tree.Proposal.Ultrametric.slideNodeAtUltrametric'.
--
-- NOTE: When applying to the root node (1) the tree heights change contrarily,
-- (2) no upper bound is used because no parent node exists, and (3) the stem of
-- the unconstrained tree is not changed because it does not map to a valid
-- branch of the ultrametric tree.
--
-- NOTE: Application of this proposal to trees with different topologies will
-- lead to unexpected behavior and possibly to run time errors.
--
-- Call 'error' if:
--
-- - The path is invalid.
--
-- - The path leads to a leaf.
--
-- - A node height or branch length is zero.

--
-- The proposal works on a parameter triple \((H, t, r)\), where \(H\) is the
-- absolute height of the time tree, \(t\) is a relative time tree, and \(r\) is
-- an absolute or relative rate tree.
--
-- Use a truncated normal distribution with given standard deviation to propose
-- a new height \(H'\) such that \(H'\) is larger than the highest daughter node
-- of the root. Let \(H'=H*u\). Scale all node heights of \(t\) contrarily. That
-- is, let \(I\) be the index set traversing the nodes of the time tree
-- excluding the leaves and the root. For any \(i \in I\), the node height
-- \(t_i\) will become \(t_i'=t_i/u\). Further, propose new rates for the rate
-- tree branches \(r_j\) leading to the root node. In particular,
-- \(r_j'=r_j\frac{1-t_j}{u-t_j}\), where \(t_j\) is the height of the node
-- corresponding to branch \(j\). In this way, the expected number of
-- substitutions on all branches stays constant.
--
-- Call 'error' if:
--
-- - The height of the relative time tree is different from 1.
